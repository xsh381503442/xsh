                 AmbiqSuite Development Package - 1.2.8

  -------------
  What is it?
  -------------

  AmbiqSuite is an extensive suite of software tools designed to simplify
  and speed up development with Ambiq Micro MCUs. It includes documentation,
  libraries, examples and functions, which are entirely written in C, to
  significantly reduce development time. It is also openly licensed and allows
  for royalty-free use.

  Directories
  -------------

  o boards:         Here you will find examples designed to run on a specific set of
                    hardware. The examples include the source, prebuilt project files and
                    binaries for each supported toolchain. In addition to the examples,
                    a board support package (bsp) is included to aid with tasks such as
                    toggling an led for that particular board.

  o devices         This directory contains all drivers for interfacing with
                    external devices such as accelerometers, gyrometers, and SPI flash's.

  o docs:           The central location for all documentation. App notes, datasheets,
                    user guides and miscellaneous documentation can be found in this directory.

  o mcu:            This directory contains the necessary include files for each Ambiq
                    Micro MCU. These files consist of hardware abstraction layer (hal)
                    in both source and library form and all of the register files needed to
                    access the internal registers of the MCU.

  o third_party:    Contains the source and/or binaries for several third party
                    providers. This allows for quicker development as they don't
                    need to be separately downloaded and are all contained in a
                    central location.

  o tools:          Contains several tools to aid in development. These are not
                    necessary to run all examples but each provides substantial
                    value and are thus included.

  o utils:          Provides some helper functions which are leveraged by multiple
                    applications that aid in performing some common functionality.
