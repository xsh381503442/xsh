1.When use optimization, all variables need to be initialized, in order to rid of wrong compiling.
2.When use optimization, all struct typedef should be :
struct s_ble_image_bank
{
	uint32_t                extFlash_address;
    uint32_t                image_size;         
    uint32_t                image_crc;  
	uint32_t            version;   	
    uint32_t                command;          
};
typedef struct s_ble_image_bank _ble_image_bank;
